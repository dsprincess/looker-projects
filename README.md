# Looker Projects

**Repository for my Google Looker Projects**

## Profitability Dashboard

Here's my initial attempt at creating a profitability dashboard using Google Looker. Previously, I created a similar dashboard in Power BI, which you can find in a separate repository.

## Transition to Google Looker

Switching to Google Looker has been challenging due to my experience with Power BI. I’ve found Looker’s interface and features less intuitive, and its blending capabilities, which support only up to five datasets, are more limited compared to Power BI’s extensive modeling functionalities.

## Future Outlook

Despite these challenges, I see potential advantages in using Google Looker, particularly for data that is already part of the Google ecosystem, such as Google Analytics. I plan to align my upcoming projects to leverage this integration.
